# AI Agent Instructions

This file serves as the **project-specific entry point** for AI agents working on this Obsidian plugin project. General-purpose instructions are located in the [`.agents`](.agents/) directory.

**Note**: The `.agents/` directory contains guidance files tailored for Obsidian plugin development. Some files are plugin-specific, while others are shared with theme development.

Applicability: Plugin
-->

### Project Overview

Zen Mode is an Obsidian plugin that hides most UI elements to enable focused content consumption and presentations. Based on the Hider plugin, it solves the problem that Obsidian is by default unfit for content consumption, especially on mobile where viewing a PDF results in less than 40% of the screen being used for the PDF.

The plugin provides a "zen mode" that hides all UI elements except the current text file or document, leaving only a single button to restore all UI. On desktop, it also collapses and restores sidebars when toggled, allowing quick switching from an editing-friendly experience to a viewing-friendly experience.

### Important Project-Specific Details

- **Project Type**: Plugin
- **Status**: Production (version 1.5.2)
- **Min App Version**: 1.8.7
- **Architecture**: Organized structure - main code in `src/main.ts` with `src/utils/` for compatibility utility
- **Key Features**:
    - Zen mode toggle (command, ribbon icon, ESC key support)
    - Sidebar management (collapses/restores on toggle)
    - Button visibility controls (always, mobile-only, never, with auto-hide on desktop)
    - Fullscreen support (automatic entry/exit)
    - CSS class injection (`zenmode-active` on body element for theme compatibility)
    - Hide properties and inline title options
    - Top/bottom padding controls
    - Focused file mode (shows only active file, hides other panes)
    - Mobile navigation bar handling with visual viewport resize support

### Maintenance Tasks

- **CSS Refactoring**: TODO - refactor CSS (lots of duplicate code, CSS formatter config needed)
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates to devDependencies as needed
- **Reference Materials**: Sync reference materials (`.ref` folder) as needed
- **Settings Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with Obsidian < 1.11.0 via settings compatibility utility

### Project-Specific Conventions

- **Code Organization**: Organized structure (`src/main.ts`) - main plugin code in src directory
- **Settings**: All settings in one interface `ZenModeSettings` with default values
- **CSS**: Uses class toggles (`zenmode-active`) and data attributes (`data-zen-hide-inline-title`, `data-zen-focused-file`) for zen mode state
- **Button Management**: Complex visibility logic with mobile/desktop differences, including auto-hide with hover reveal on desktop
- **Event Handling**: ESC key handling with vim mode detection to avoid conflicts
- **Mobile Support**: Visual viewport resize handling for mobile navigation bars
- **Workspace API**: Uses workspace leaf API for focused file mode

### Project-Specific References

- `.ref/plugins/obsidian-ui-tweaker/` - Reference implementation for SettingGroup usage and settings compatibility patterns. Used as a local project reference (symlink to `C:\Users\david\Development\obsidian-ui-tweaker`).

### Overrides (Optional)

None currently. This project follows the general `.agents` guidance.

### Key Files and Their Purposes

- `src/main.ts` - Main plugin code, settings interface (`ZenModeSettings`), default settings, and settings tab (`ZenModeSettingTab`) - all in one file
- `styles.css` - Zen mode styling (needs refactoring per TODO)
- `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata (minAppVersion: 1.8.7, version: 1.5.2)
- `src/utils/settings-compat.ts` - Settings compatibility utility for SettingGroup (provides backward compatibility with Obsidian < 1.11.0)
- `esbuild.config.mjs` - Build configuration (uses `src/main.ts` as entry point, with fallback support for root `main.ts`)
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint 9 flat config configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

### Development Notes

- **Theme Compatibility**: Uses `zenmode-active` class on `body` element when active, allowing themes to style zen mode appropriately
- **Button Positioning**: Complex button positioning logic for mobile navigation bars, accounting for Android navigation bars that may not be detected by CSS `safe-area-inset`
- **ESC Key Handling**: Detects vim mode to avoid interfering with vim's ESC usage. Also checks for open modals before exiting zen mode
- **Visual Viewport**: Uses `window.visualViewport` API for better mobile support when navigation bars appear/disappear
- **Focused File Mode**: Uses workspace leaf API to identify active leaf and hide/show tab containers accordingly
- **Settings Compatibility**: The `src/utils/settings-compat.ts` utility ensures the plugin works on both Obsidian 1.11.0+ (with SettingGroup) and older versions (with fallback). Uses `requireApiVersion('1.11.0')` for version checking
- **DOM Structure**: All settings are grouped using SettingGroup (or fallback) to maintain proper spacing. No divs are created directly on `containerEl` outside of SettingGroup structure

## Quick Start

**All general-purpose agent instructions are located in the [`.agents`](.agents/) directory**.

**Quick Commands**: See [quick-reference.md](.agents/quick-reference.md#quick-commands) for one-word commands like `build`, `sync`, `release ready?`, `summarize`, `bump the version`, etc. **AI Agents: Execute these commands automatically when users type them** (detailed execution instructions are in the Help sections below).

**New to this project?** Start here:

0. **Set up reference materials**: Check if `.ref` folder exists and has symlinks. If not, run the setup script:
    - **Windows**: `scripts\setup-ref-links.bat`
    - **macOS/Linux**: `./scripts/setup-ref-links.sh`
    - The script will automatically create `../.ref/obsidian-dev/` (if needed), clone the 6 core Obsidian projects (or update them if they already exist), and create symlinks

1. Read the **Project Context** section above for project-specific information and overrides

2. Read [project-overview.md](.agents/project-overview.md) to understand the structure

3. Check [environment.md](.agents/environment.md) for setup requirements

4. Review [common-tasks.md](.agents/common-tasks.md) for quick code snippets

5. See [code-patterns.md](.agents/code-patterns.md) for complete examples

6. Bookmark [quick-reference.md](.agents/quick-reference.md) for common commands

**Note**: For complex projects, see `.agents/.context/` directory (optional advanced feature).

## When to Check .ref Folder Setup

**AI Agents: Only check `.ref` folder setup when user explicitly asks about:**

- "What does the Obsidian API say about X?"
- "Check the latest Obsidian documentation"
- "What's the latest API?"
- "Look up [feature] in the Obsidian docs"
- "What does the Obsidian documentation say?"
- "Check obsidian-api for..."
- Similar explicit requests about API or documentation

**Do NOT check `.ref` automatically for regular coding tasks.** Most users may never need it, and it shouldn't be a barrier to getting work done.

**When triggered:**

1. Check if `.ref/obsidian-api` exists (note: this may be a symlink pointing to a central location)
2. If missing, run setup script: `scripts\setup-ref-links.bat` (Windows) or `./scripts/setup-ref-links.sh` (Unix)
3. If it exists but git commands fail, check if it's a symlink and navigate to the actual target location
4. Then proceed with the API/documentation lookup

**Quick check commands:**

- Windows: `Test-Path .ref/obsidian-api`
- Unix: `test -d .ref/obsidian-api`

## Help: Interactive Guidance

**When the user asks for "help"**:

1. **First, display the Quick Commands table**: Read and show the Quick Commands section from [quick-reference.md](.agents/quick-reference.md#quick-commands) (the table with all one-word commands)
2. **Then, present these additional options** below for more detailed workflows:

**When the user asks for "what's the latest"**, present these options and guide them based on their choice:

---

### Option 0: Check for Updates / "What's the Latest"

**Present this option when**: User explicitly asks "what's the latest", "check for updates", "what does the Obsidian documentation say", or wants to see what's new in reference repos.

**Important**: Updates are **optional**. The reference materials work fine with whatever version was cloned initially. Most users never need to update. This is only for users who want the latest documentation.

**Instructions for AI agent**:

1. **First, ensure `.ref` folder is set up**: Check if `.ref/obsidian-api` exists. If not, run the setup script first (see "When to Check .ref Folder Setup" above).
2. **Determine setup**: Check if `.ref` contains symlinks (see [sync-procedure.md](.agents/sync-procedure.md#step-1-determine-your-ref-setup) for how to check). If symlinks, note the target location (usually `..\.ref\obsidian-dev`).
3. **Check for updates** (read-only, safe):
    - **For core Obsidian projects**: Check `.ref/` root (all 6: obsidian-api, obsidian-sample-plugin, obsidian-developer-docs, obsidian-plugin-docs, obsidian-sample-theme, eslint-plugin)
    - **For project-specific repos**: Check `.ref/plugins/` or `.ref/themes/` (only if documented in this `AGENTS.md`)
4. **Use read-only git commands** (from actual target location if using symlinks):
    ```bash
    # If using symlinks, navigate to central location first (usually ..\.ref\obsidian-dev)
    # If using local clones, use .ref/obsidian-api directly
    cd ../.ref/obsidian-dev/obsidian-api  # or .ref/obsidian-api for local clones
    git fetch
    git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline  # Shows what's new
    ```
5. **Report findings**: Show what's new and ask if they want to pull updates
6. **Never automatically pull** - always ask first (see [agent-dos-donts.md](.agents/agent-dos-donts.md))

**Key files**: [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md#checking-for-updates-to-reference-repos), [quick-sync-guide.md](.agents/quick-sync-guide.md), [sync-procedure.md](.agents/sync-procedure.md)

---

### Option 1: Sync Reference Documentation

**Present this option when**: User says "sync" or "quick sync" - they want to pull latest changes from all 6 core `.ref` repos.

**Instructions for AI agent** (execute automatically, don't just show commands):

1. **Determine setup**: Check if `.ref` contains symlinks (see [sync-procedure.md](.agents/sync-procedure.md#step-1-determine-your-ref-setup)). This determines where to run git commands.
2. **Execute git pull commands**: Actually run `git pull` for all 6 core repos:
    - Navigate to the actual target location (usually `../.ref/obsidian-dev` if using symlinks)
    - Run `git pull` in each of the 6 repos: obsidian-api, obsidian-sample-plugin, obsidian-developer-docs, obsidian-plugin-docs, obsidian-sample-theme, eslint-plugin
    - See [quick-sync-guide.md](.agents/quick-sync-guide.md) for exact commands
3. **Review changes**: Check git logs to see what changed in each repo (optional, but helpful)
4. **Update `.agents/` files**: If user wants, compare changes and update relevant files (optional)
5. **Update sync status**: Update `.agents/sync-status.json` with current date

**The 6 core Obsidian projects** (always relevant):

- obsidian-api
- obsidian-sample-plugin
- obsidian-developer-docs
- obsidian-plugin-docs
- obsidian-sample-theme
- eslint-plugin

**Key files**: [sync-procedure.md](.agents/sync-procedure.md), [quick-sync-guide.md](.agents/quick-sync-guide.md)

---

### Option 2: Add a Project to Your References

**Present this option when**: User says "add ref [name]" or "add ref [name] [URL/path]" - they want to reference another project.

**Instructions for AI agent** (execute automatically, don't just show commands):

1. **Parse the command**: Extract the name and optional URL/path from user input
    - If URL provided (starts with `http://`, `https://`, `git@`, etc.) → External repository
    - If path provided (starts with `../`, `./`, `/`, `C:\`, etc.) → Local project
    - If only name provided → Ask user: "Is this an external repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) or a local project path?"
2. **If external repository** (execute these steps):
    - **Determine type**: Is it a plugin, theme, or other project? (infer from URL or ask)
    - **Check if already exists**: Check `../.ref/obsidian-dev/plugins/<name>/` (for plugins), `../.ref/obsidian-dev/themes/<name>/` (for themes), or `../.ref/obsidian-dev/<name>/` (for other projects)
    - **Execute clone command** (NOT into a `.ref` subfolder!):
        - For plugins: Run `cd ../.ref/obsidian-dev/plugins && git clone <URL> <name>` → Creates `../.ref/obsidian-dev/plugins/<name>/` (the actual repo)
        - For themes: Run `cd ../.ref/obsidian-dev/themes && git clone <URL> <name>` → Creates `../.ref/obsidian-dev/themes/<name>/` (the actual repo)
        - For other projects: Run `cd ../.ref/obsidian-dev && git clone <URL> <name>` → Creates `../.ref/obsidian-dev/<name>/` (the actual repo)
    - **Execute symlink creation**: Create symlink at `.ref/plugins/<name>/` (or `.ref/themes/<name>/` or `.ref/<name>/`) pointing to the global location
    - **Document if project-specific**: Document in this `AGENTS.md` if it's project-specific

    **IMPORTANT**: Clone the repo directly into the target folder (e.g., `../.ref/obsidian-dev/plugins/plugin-name/`), NOT into a `.ref` subfolder. The repo folder name should match the project name.

3. **If local project** (execute these steps):
    - **Verify path exists**: Check that the local path exists
    - **Execute symlink creation**: Create symlink directly in project's `.ref/` folder pointing to the local project (e.g., `../my-other-plugin`)
    - **Do NOT** clone to global `.ref/obsidian-dev/` - this is project-specific
    - Document in this `AGENTS.md` if relevant

4. **Verify**: Check that the symlink was created and works (test by listing directory or reading a file)

**Key file**: [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md) - See "Adding Additional References" section

---

### Option 3: Bump the Version

**Present this option when**: User says "bump the version", "bump version", or similar - they want to increment the version number.

**Instructions for AI agent** (execute automatically, don't just show commands):

1. **Parse the command**: Extract the version increment type from user input
    - If no type specified → Default to `patch` (bumps by 0.0.1)
    - If user specifies `patch`, `minor`, or `major` → Use that type
    - If user specifies an exact version (e.g., "1.2.3") → Use that version
2. **Execute version bump**:
    - Run `npm version <type>` where `<type>` is one of:
        - `patch` (default) - bumps patch version: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
        - `minor` - bumps minor version: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
        - `major` - bumps major version: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
        - Or exact version: `1.2.3` (sets to that version)
    - The `npm version` command automatically:
        - Updates `package.json` version
        - Runs the `version` script in `package.json` (which updates `manifest.json` and `versions.json` via `version-bump.mjs`)
        - Stages `manifest.json` and `versions.json` for commit
3. **Verify**: Check that both `package.json` and `manifest.json` have the new version

**Examples**:

- `bump the version` → Runs `npm version patch` (default: 0.0.1 increment)
- `bump version minor` → Runs `npm version minor`
- `bump version major` → Runs `npm version major`
- `bump version 1.2.3` → Runs `npm version 1.2.3`

**Key files**: [versioning-releases.md](.agents/versioning-releases.md), `package.json`, `manifest.json`, `version-bump.mjs`

---

### Option 4: Start a New Plugin Project

**Present this option when**: User wants to create a new Obsidian plugin.

**Instructions for AI agent** - Follow this funnel:

1. **Plugin Funnel** - Ask these questions in order:
    - "What functionality do you want your plugin to provide?" (core purpose)
    - "Will it need user settings or configuration?" → If yes, point to [commands-settings.md](.agents/commands-settings.md)
    - "What will it interact with?" (vault files, editor, UI components, workspace)
    - "Do you need any external API integrations?" → If yes, review [security-privacy.md](.agents/security-privacy.md) for guidelines
    - "Will it work on mobile, or desktop-only?" → Point to [mobile.md](.agents/mobile.md) and `isDesktopOnly` in [manifest.md](.agents/manifest.md)

2. **After gathering answers**, guide them to:
    - [project-overview.md](.agents/project-overview.md) - Project structure
    - [environment.md](.agents/environment.md) - Setup and tooling
    - [file-conventions.md](.agents/file-conventions.md) - File organization
    - [common-tasks.md](.agents/common-tasks.md) - Code examples
    - [references.md](.agents/references.md) - Official documentation links
    - **Set up `.ref` folder**: Run the setup script (`scripts/setup-ref-links.bat` or `.sh`) to configure reference materials

**Key files**: [project-overview.md](.agents/project-overview.md), [common-tasks.md](.agents/common-tasks.md), [references.md](.agents/references.md), [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md)

## Static vs. Project-Specific Files

**General `.agents` files** (most files in the `.agents/` directory):

- Are synced from reference repos (Sample Plugin, API, etc.)
- Should remain static and not be edited directly in plugin projects
- Provide guidance tailored for Obsidian plugin development
- Some files are plugin-specific, others are shared with theme development
- Can be updated by syncing from reference repositories

**Project-specific files**:

- **This `AGENTS.md` file** - Contains project-specific information and overrides (replaces the old `project-context.md`)
    - Contains project overview, specific details, maintenance tasks, and conventions
    - Can override general `.agents` guidance when project-specific needs differ
    - Is preserved when syncing updates from reference repos
- **`.agents/.context/` directory** - Optional advanced feature for complex projects
    - Use when you need project-specific versions of multiple `.agents` files
    - Only create files that differ from general guidance
    - Structure mirrors `.agents/` directory (e.g., `.context/build-workflow.md`, `.context/code-patterns.md`)
    - Entry point: `.agents/.context/AGENTS.md` (if it exists)

**Precedence**: When conflicts exist, project-specific files take precedence over general guidance.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized into topic-based files in the `.agents/` directory. Most files are **general-purpose** and apply to all Obsidian plugins/themes. Some files are **project-specific** and can override general guidance.

**Key concepts**:

- **General files**: Synced from official Obsidian repos, provide standard guidance
- **Project-specific files**: This `AGENTS.md` file (and optional `.agents/.context/` directory) contain project-specific information
- **Precedence**: Project-specific files override general guidance when conflicts exist
- **`.ref` folder**: Contains symlinks to reference materials (not actual files). See [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md) for details.
- **`.agents/` folder**: Contains general-purpose guidance files for Obsidian plugin and theme development

## Important: .ref Folder

The `.ref` folder contains **symlinks** to reference materials (not actual files). It's gitignored and acts as a "portal" to other locations on the computer.

**For AI Agents**:

- **Only when user explicitly asks about API/docs**: Check if `.ref/obsidian-api` exists. If not, run the setup script to create it (see "When to Check .ref Folder Setup" above)
- **When asked to reference something**: Actively search for it using `list_dir`, `glob_file_search`, or `read_file`
- **When adding references**:
    - External repos → Clone to `../.ref/obsidian-dev/` (global), then symlink in project's `.ref/`
    - Local projects → Symlink directly in project's `.ref/` (don't clone to global)
- **The `.ref` folder may be hidden** by default in file explorers, but it exists in the project root

**Setup**: The setup scripts (`scripts/setup-ref-links.*`) automatically:

1. Create `../.ref/` if it doesn't exist
2. Create `../.ref/obsidian-dev/` subfolder if it doesn't exist
3. Clone the 6 core Obsidian projects to `../.ref/obsidian-dev/` if they don't exist, or pull latest changes if they do exist
4. Create `../.ref/obsidian-dev/plugins/` and `../.ref/obsidian-dev/themes/` folders
5. Create symlinks in the project's `.ref/` folder pointing to `../.ref/obsidian-dev/`

**Philosophy**: It "just works" out of the box. The reference materials are cloned once and work indefinitely. The setup scripts automatically update repos when run, so you can keep them up to date by simply re-running the setup script. Updates are optional and only needed if you want the latest documentation. Most users never update, and that's perfectly fine.

See [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md) for complete details.

## Important: .agents Folder

The `.agents/` directory contains guidance files tailored for Obsidian plugin development. This directory structure provides:

- **Plugin-specific guidance**: Files like `code-patterns.md`, `commands-settings.md`, and `release-readiness.md` are plugin-only
- **Shared guidance**: Files like `build-workflow.md`, `file-conventions.md`, and `versioning-releases.md` have sections for both plugins and themes
- **Project-specific content**: This `AGENTS.md` file remains project-specific and contains project-specific information
- **Easy maintenance**: Files can be updated by syncing from reference repositories

**Note**: The `.agents/` folder may be hidden by default in some file explorers, but it exists in the project root.

## Source Attribution

Each file in `.agents` includes a header comment with:

- Source(s) of the information
- Last sync date (for reference; see [sync-status.json](.agents/sync-status.json) for authoritative dates)
- Update frequency guidance

**Central Sync Tracking**: All sync dates are tracked centrally in [sync-status.json](.agents/sync-status.json). When syncing content, update this file with the actual current date (never use placeholder dates).

## Updating Content

Content in the `.agents/` directory is based on:

- **Obsidian API** (`.ref/obsidian-api/obsidian.d.ts`) - **Authoritative source** for all API information
- Obsidian Sample Plugin repository - Implementation patterns and best practices
- Obsidian Sample Theme repository - Theme patterns
- Obsidian Plugin Docs and Developer Docs - General guidance (may be outdated, always verify against API)
- Community best practices

**Important**: The `obsidian-api` repository is the authoritative source. When information conflicts between API and documentation, the API takes precedence. Always check `.ref/obsidian-api/obsidian.d.ts` first, especially for new features (e.g., `SettingGroup` since 1.11.0).

Check the source attribution in each file header for update frequency guidance. When the Obsidian Sample Plugin, Sample Theme, or API documentation is updated, relevant files here should be reviewed and updated accordingly.

**See [sync-procedure.md](.agents/sync-procedure.md) for the standard procedure to sync content from the latest Sample Plugin, Sample Theme, and API updates.**

## General Purpose / Reusable

The `.agents` directory structure and content is designed to be **general-purpose and reusable** across Obsidian plugin and theme projects. The content is based on official Obsidian repositories and documentation, not project-specific code. You can:

- Copy this structure to other Obsidian projects
- Use it as a template for new projects
- Share it with other developers
- Adapt it for your specific needs

The only project-specific content is in:

- This `AGENTS.md` file - Project-specific information and overrides (maintained by developer)
- `.agents/.context/` directory - Optional project-specific structure for complex projects (if it exists)
- `ref-instructions.md` - OS-agnostic setup instructions that may need path adjustments

Everything else syncs from official Obsidian sources.

## Troubleshooting

**If `.ref` folder is missing or empty**:

- Run the setup script: `scripts\setup-ref-links.bat` (Windows) or `./scripts/setup-ref-links.sh` (macOS/Linux)
- The script will automatically set everything up

**If `.agents` folder is missing**:

- The `.agents/` folder should exist in the project root
- If it's missing, it may need to be created or restored from the project template

**If symlinks are broken**:

- Re-run the appropriate setup script - it will recreate the symlinks

**If you can't find a reference**:

- Check [ref-instructions.md](.agents/ref-instructions.md) for organization
- Check this `AGENTS.md` file for project-specific references
- Use `list_dir` or `glob_file_search` to search `.ref/` folder

**If build fails**:

- See [build-workflow.md](.agents/build-workflow.md) for build commands
- See [troubleshooting.md](.agents/troubleshooting.md) for common issues
- See [common-pitfalls.md](.agents/common-pitfalls.md) for common mistakes
