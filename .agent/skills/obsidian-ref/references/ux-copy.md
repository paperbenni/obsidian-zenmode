# UX & copy guidelines (for UI text, commands, settings)

- Prefer sentence case for headings, buttons, and titles.
- Use clear, action-oriented imperatives in step-by-step copy.
- Use **bold** to indicate literal UI labels. Prefer "select" for interactions.
- Use arrow notation for navigation: **Settings → Community plugins**.
- Keep in-app strings short, consistent, and free of jargon.
- **Terminology**: 
- Both "properties" and "frontmatter" are valid Obsidian terms with distinct meanings: use "properties" when referring to the Properties pane UI (editable typed metadata) and "frontmatter" when referring to the underlying YAML block serialized between --- markers. This aligns with Obsidian's official terminology.
  - Use "Markdown" (capitalized, as a proper noun) in UI text. This aligns with standard terminology conventions.
  - Use "file name" (two words, not "filename") when referring to the name of a file. This aligns with Obsidian's official terminology.
