# Obsidian Reference Skill

This skill provides comprehensive technical references and standards for the Obsidian ecosystem.

## Purpose

To provide a central source of truth for API usage, file formats, and design standards.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Verifying `manifest.json` requirements.
- Checking Obsidian API details or documentation.
- Working with Obsidian-specific file formats (Markdown, Canvas).
- Reviewing UI text or UX patterns for consistency.

## Core Rules

- **API Authority**: The `obsidian.d.ts` file in the reference materials is the authoritative source for API details.
- **Terminology Consistency**: Follow the "properties" and "Markdown" naming conventions strictly.
- **Mobile First**: Consider mobile compatibility for all UI and file-handling features.
