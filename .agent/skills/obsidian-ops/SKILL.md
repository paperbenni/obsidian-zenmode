# Obsidian Operations Skill

This skill covers the operational aspects of maintaining an Obsidian project, including build workflows, sync procedures, and release management.

## Purpose

To ensure reliable builds, consistent reference materials, and safe release processes while strictly following project policies.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Running build or lint commands.
- Syncing reference documentation from external sources.
- Bumping project versions or preparing releases.
- Troubleshooting build or environment issues.

## Core Rules

- **NEVER perform automatic git operations**: AI agents must never execute `git commit`, `git push`, or any command that automatically stages or commits changes without explicit user approval for each step.
- **Verify Build**: Always run a build/lint after significant changes to ensure compatibility.
- **Sync Status**: Keep `sync-status.json` updated when updating reference materials.
