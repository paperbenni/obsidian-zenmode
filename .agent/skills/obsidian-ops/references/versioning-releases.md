# Versioning & releases

**Before releasing**: Use the comprehensive [release-readiness.md](release-readiness.md) checklist to verify your theme is ready for release.

- Bump `version` in `manifest.json` (SemVer).
- Create a GitHub release whose tag exactly matches `manifest.json`'s `version`. Do not use a leading `v`.
- Attach `manifest.json` and `theme.css` to the release as individual assets.
- After the initial release, follow the process to add/update your theme in the community catalog as required.
